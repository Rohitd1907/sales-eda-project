- Perform data cleaning and transformation
- Analyze sales trends across months and sub-categories
- Visualize relationships between sales, profit, and discount
- Identify high-performing and underperforming sub-categories
- Understand regional or categorical distribution (based on available data)

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

> This is optional if you're only showcasing your project, but helpful if others want to replicate it.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohitd1907/sales-eda-project.git
   cd sales-eda-project
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
   ``` bash
   jupyter notebook Sales_EDA_Project.ipynb
3. Run the cells in sequence to explore the analysis.

   Key Insights (Summary)
   Certain sub-categories like Chairs and Tables show high sales but poor profit margins.
   Discount has a clear inverse relationship with Profit, confirmed via regression plots.
   The highest sales occur in specific months (as shown in monthly trend line chart).
   Some sub-categories contribute significantly to losses — an opportunity for strategic review.
